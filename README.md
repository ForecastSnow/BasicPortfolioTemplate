🚀 The "No-Nonsense" Developer Portfolio

You can see the functional deployment at this [link](https://tomasperez.work)

A high-performance, minimalist, and modular portfolio template built for developers who care about code quality and user psychology.

    Note: The content within the portfolio is currently in Spanish 🇦🇷 (perfect for local markets), but the code structure is universal.

    Note 2: I know the experience section is missing; I haven't needed to include it yet, but you can always add it.

🧠 The Philosophy (Social Engineering UI)

This isn't just a theme switch; it's a context switch tailored for the viewer:

    ☀️ Light Mode (HR & Recruiters): Clean, transparent, "being of light" vibes. It screams "I am a happy team player who loves agile meetings."

    🌙 Dark Mode (Tech Leads & Devs): Premium, gamer-aesthetic, terminal-inspired. It whispers "I write clean code at 2 AM and I know what a segfault is."

✨ Key Features

    Modular Architecture: Built with strict separation of concerns. You don't need to dig into App.tsx to change your name.

    Blazing Fast: Powered by Vite. It loads before you can blink.

    Responsive: Looks good on a 4k monitor and a potato phone.

## ⚡ Prerequisites

    This is a **code-first** portfolio. There is no Admin Panel or CMS.
    To use this, you need:
    1.  **Node.js** installed.
    2.  **Basic knowledge** of React/HTML (you just need to know how to edit text inside a component).

    *If you can't find where to change your name in the code, you probably shouldn't be using a Developer portfolio template yet.* 😉
